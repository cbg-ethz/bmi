# Benchmarking Mutual Information

BMI is the package for estimation of mutual information between continuous random variables and testing new estimators.

- **Documentation**: [https://cbg-ethz.github.io/bmi/](https://cbg-ethz.github.io/bmi/)
- **Source code**: [https://github.com/cbg-ethz/bmi](https://github.com/cbg-ethz/bmi)
- **Bug reports**: [https://github.com/cbg-ethz/bmi/issues](https://github.com/cbg-ethz/bmi/issues)
- **PyPI package**: [https://pypi.org/project/benchmark-mi](https://pypi.org/project/benchmark-mi)

## Getting started
While we recommend taking a look at the [documentation](https://cbg-ethz.github.io/bmi/) to learn about full package capabilities, below we present the main capabilities of the Python package.
(Note that BMI can also be used to test non-Python mutual information estimators.)

You can install the package using:

```bash
$ pip install benchmark-mi
```

Alternatively, you can use the development version from source using:

```bash
$ pip install "bmi @ https://github.com/cbg-ethz/bmi"
```

Note: BMI uses [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and by default installs the CPU version of it.
If you have a device supporting CUDA, you can [install the CUDA version of JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#pip-installation-gpu-cuda-installed-via-pip-easier).

Now let's take one of the predefined distributions included in the benchmark (named "tasks") and sample 1,000 data points.
Then, we will run two estimators on this task.

```python
import bmi

task = bmi.benchmark.BENCHMARK_TASKS['1v1-normal-0.75']
print(f"Task {task.name} with dimensions {task.dim_x} and {task.dim_y}")
print(f"Ground truth mutual information: {task.mutual_information:.2f}")

X, Y = task.sample(1000, seed=42)

cca = bmi.estimators.CCAMutualInformationEstimator()
print(f"Estimate by CCA: {cca.estimate(X, Y):.2f}")

ksg = bmi.estimators.KSGEnsembleFirstEstimator(neighborhoods=(5,))
print(f"Estimate by KSG: {ksg.estimate(X, Y):.2f}")
```

## Evaluating a new estimator

The above code snippet may be convenient for estimating mutual information on a given data set or for the development of a new mutual information estimator.
However, for extensive benchmarking it may be more convenient to use one of the benchmark suites available in the `workflows/benchmark/` subdirectory.

For example, you can install [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and run a small benchmark suite on several estimators using:

```bash
$ snakemake -c4 -s workflows/benchmark/demo/run.smk
```

In about a minute it should generate minibenchmark results in the `generated/benchmark/demo` directory. Note that the configuration file, `workflows/benchmark/demo/config.py`, explicitly defines the estimators and tasks used, as well as the number of samples.

Hence, it is easy to benchmark a custom estimator by importing it and including it in the configuration dictionary.
More information is available [here](https://cbg-ethz.github.io/bmi/benchmarking-new-estimator/), where we cover evaluating new Python as well as non-Python estimators.

Similarly, it is easy to change the number of samples or adjust the tasks included in the benchmark.
We defined several benchmark suites with shared structure.
