Mutual information estimators and benchmark.

_The package is still in early development phase and the public API is very fluid. We hope it will stabilize in May 2023._

Install the package in the editable mode, together with testing utilities:

    $ pip install -e ".[test]"

Install the pre-commit hooks:
