# BMI (Benchmarking Mutual Information)

BMI is the package for estimation of mutual information between continuous random variables and testing new estimators.

- **Documentation**: **TODO**: Add link to the documentation.
- **Source code**: [https://github.com/cbg-ethz/bmi](https://github.com/cbg-ethz/bmi)
- **Bug reports**: [https://github.com/cbg-ethz/bmi/issues](https://github.com/cbg-ethz/bmi/issues)


## BMI in five minutes

While we recommend taking a look at the documentation to learn about full package capabilities, below we present the main capabilities of the Python package.
(Note that BMI can also be used to test non-Python mutual information estimators.)

### Installation
**TODO:** Add installation instructions after we push to PyPI.

BMI uses [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and by default installs the CPU version of it.
If you have a device supporting CUDA, you can [install the CUDA version of JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#pip-installation-gpu-cuda-installed-via-pip-easier).

### Loading a task

## Citing

**TODO:** Add link to arXiv preprint and generate a BibTeX entry.
