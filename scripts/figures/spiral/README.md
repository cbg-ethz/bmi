# Invariance to the spiral diffeomorphism

In this directory we store the scripts which can be used to reproduce the plot representing
whether the mutual information estimates are invariant to the spiral diffeomorphism.

  - `visualise_spiral.py`: plots a figure visualising spirals with different speed parameters.
  - `generate_spiral.py`: generates tasks with different speed parameters and saves them.
  - `run_estimator.py`: runs the estimators
