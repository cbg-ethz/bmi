# Workflows

This directory contains [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflows. These workflows serve two different purposes:

- `benchmark`: workflows for the development and benchmarking of new estimators. They are designed to be lean, modular, and easy to use.
- `projects`: workflows we used to perform experiments in our manuscripts. They are included for reproducibility purposes, but they are less convenient for the development of new estimators.
